For web applications this is done through a web browser, like the one you're using to read this with. The UI is made up of 3 parts:\r\n  1. *Structure* - The content of the UI.\r\n  2. *Presentation* - How the content is displayed.\r\n  3. *Behaviour* - How the content behaves when certain actions occur.\r\n\r\nThese 3 components correspond to the 3 technologies we're going to be looking at:\r\n  1. *Structure* - HTML\r\n  2. *Presentation* - CSS\r\n  3. *Behaviour* - JavaScript\r\n\r\nWeb pages used to have these 3 technologies jumbled together, in short, it was a nightmare. Over time practices have changed so that now our HTML, CSS and JS are all separated.\r\n\r\nThis means that if we want to change how a website looks, we need to only swap out the corresponding CSS files, and any images used instead of having to root through HTML files looking for all CSS references.\r\n\r\n###Why?\r\n* _Accessibility_ - easy to use with screen readers and other accessibility devices\r\n* _Portability_ - easy to make a web page support mobile or tablet formats\r\n* _Maintainability_ - easy to make changes to on component without much effect on the others\r\n* _Reduced Latency_ - we can use caching techniques to have browsers download the CSS or JS files once, and check after a determined expiry period, meaning they don't have to download them every time they visit.\r\n* _Graceful Degradation_ - The web page will still function if the CSS or JS files don't get loaded in, for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a website that does this [here](http://webremix.org/labs/lab2/demos/demo.html) or just follow along with the screen shots below.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/images/demo_page.jpg \"http://webremix.org/labs/lab2/demos/demo.html\")\r\nAs you can see, the page has an interactive navigation bar at the top that highlights whatever is hovered over, and displays a list of items under the 'Contact' tab. \r\nIt also has lists of links on the left that can be shrunk or expanded by clicking on the '-' or '+' buttons, this is provided by JavaScript. \r\nThere is also a form for submitting data and table for displaying it.\r\n\r\nIf we disable the JavaScript, we can see below that the only change is that the '-' and '+' buttons are gone from the quicklink lists, there have been other changes but they're more subtle.\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/images/demo_page_no_js.jpg \"Javascript disabled\")\r\n\r\nFinally if we disable CSS as well, we end up with a rather barebones, but still functional web page.\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/images/demo_page_no_css_js.jpg \"CSS and Javascript disabled\")\r\n\r\n\r\n###Recap\r\nSo far we've learned what each of the web technologies we're looking at is for, and how they affect different parts of the page's functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nHTML\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nAs we've already learned, HTML is used to define the content and structure of a webpage.\r\n\r\nOne of the common misconceptions is that HTML is a programming language, it's not.\r\nMarkup languages like HTML add structured information, a markup language called markdown was used to write this tutorial.\r\n\r\n###What does it look like?\r\nYou may have seen HTML before, but if not is looks something like this\r\n```HTML\r\n<tagname attribute='value'>\r\n  content\r\n</tagname>\r\n\r\n<p id='id' class='classname'>\r\n  Lorem ipsum dolorem...\r\n</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the section above, there are two __elements__, a tagname and a paragraph. Each element has an opening tag, some content and a closing tag. Elements can also be nested inside each other, creating what is known as a tree.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph element seen above has both an id and a class, these are used to identify it for CSS and JavaScript. \r\n__Id's should be unique, classes can be reused.__\r\n\r\nSince HTML is the skeleton of the web page, you should write this first, then add style and behaviour afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe'll very briefly cover some of the common HTML elements.\r\n\r\n###Headers\r\nHeader tags are used in HTML to create headlines that separate sections of content, these have been used throughout this page.\r\n\r\nHeader tags look like the following\r\n```HTML\r\n<h1>Header</h1>\r\n<h2>Header</h2>\r\n<h3>Header</h3>\r\n...\r\n<h6>Header</h6>\r\n```\r\n\r\nH1 tags are used for main headings, with the decreasing numbers being used for less important headings. \r\n\r\nIt's important not to use these headings for their size, as that can be changed in the CSS, but to separate content. \r\n\r\nYou ideally shouldn't use h1 for main headers then h3 tags for subheadings.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Paragraphs\r\nParagraphs `<p>content</p>` are used to display, as their name suggests, paragraphs of content.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Lists\r\nLists are, you guessed it, used to display lists of content such as links.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of lists in HTML, both of which you've already seen, Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists.\r\n\r\n####Ordered Lists\r\n```HTML\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Item</li>\r\n  ...\r\n</ol>\r\n```\r\nOrdered lists should be used for lists when the order of items is significant, such as for search results or instructions.\r\n\r\n####Unordered Lists\r\n```HTML\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Item</li>\r\n  ...\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\nIn contrast, unordered lists can be used for lists where the order doesn't matter, like a shopping list.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Emphasized text\r\nText can be emphasized in HTML using the `<em>text</em>` tag, this is better than the older `<i>` tags, which aren't always picked up by screen readers used by those who are visually impaired.\r\n\r\nIn a regular browser this is displayed in italics, where as a screen reader will rise in pitch.\r\n\r\n###Bold text\r\nText can also be displayed in bold, this used to be done with the `<b>` tag, but it's now recommended to use the `<strong>` tag instead, for reasons similar to the emphasized text tags.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Tables\r\n```HTML\r\n<table>               <!--opening table tag-->\r\n  <tr>                <!--opening row tag-->\r\n    <th>Name</th>     <!--define table headers-->\r\n    <th>Age</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Andrew</td>   <!--define table cells-->\r\n    <td>22</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\nAs seen above, tables are made up of 3 parts, denoted by the comments.\r\n\r\n1. table tags - used to open and close the table\r\n2. table rows - used to open and close a row\r\n3. table headers - used to define a header cell for all cells beneath it\r\n4. table cells - used to define a regular cell\r\n\r\n\r\n###Doctype\r\nFinally, and also most importantly, you should always start your HTML page with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, this tells your browser that it's adhering to HTML standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Recap\r\nIn this section we've looked at some of the common HTML elements and how they should be used for the type of content to be displayed, and never because of how they appear in the browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHTML Exercise\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nOkay, so now that we've learned some of the basics of HTML, but first we need to install a tool to write it with. If you're using Windows I recommend you download either [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [crimson editor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com/).\r\n\r\nNow let's download our specification for this exercise. You can copy the file contents from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/exercises/html-exercise-unfinished.html).\r\n\r\nWe're going to pretend that we've been given this template from a customer, who wants a web page that has this content. So to start we'll work on the HTML portion for this exercise.\r\n\r\nSo, breaking this up into parts, how do we mark up:\r\n1. the text 'Web Developers, Inc.'?\r\n2. site navigation\r\n3. related brands, title of a section\r\n  * the brands inside the related brands section, should it be ordered or unordered?\r\n4. sign up, probably equal importance as related brands\r\n  * the create a user section\r\n5. block of text\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask for help or ask someone's opinion. \r\n__You can also go ahead and Google for a particular tag if you don't know what it is, it's usually best to search for something like 'HTML tag form input' if, for example, you were wanting to find the tag to create input for a form.__\r\n\r\nOnce you think you're done, get a couple of other people to look it over, these can be the people around you! Discuss it and see what other people think, it's okay to disagree as long as you have a reason for why you made your decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCSS\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS), as we've mentioned before, modifies the style of your page's content.\r\n\r\n###How do we get it into my web page?\r\nThere are 3 possible options, from worst to best.\r\n\r\n1. Inline CSS (Bad, don't ever do this) - \r\n  ```HTML\r\n  <body>\r\n  <h1 style=\"color: red;\">Hello</h1>\r\n  <body>\r\n  ```\r\n  Using the style attribute on an element, you can change the a particular element, but you're mixing your content and style, and also means you have to do this for each element you want to style. *Even control-c, control-v gets boring after a while*\r\n\r\n2. Embedded CSS (Okay, but not great either) - \r\n  ```HTML\r\n  <head>\r\n  <style type=\"text/css\">\r\n    p {\r\n        color: red;\r\n    }\r\n  </style>\r\n  </head>\r\n  ```\r\n  This makes use of the `<style>` tag to affect whatever elements in your page you select inside it, for example in this example we make all paragraph elements red.\r\n\r\n3. External CSS (Good) - \r\n  ```HTML\r\n  <head>\r\n  <link\r\n    rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n    href=\"my_styles.css\">\r\n  </head>\r\n  ```\r\n  This is the best of all, it uses the `<style>` tag from before, but downloads the stylesheet (that's the one with the .css extension) and applies it to this page. This allows us to write one stylesheet to affect an entire site instead of rewriting all the CSS for each page!\r\n\r\n\r\n###How does it work?\r\nCSS has 3 parts:\r\n1. Selector\r\n2. Properties\r\n3. Values\r\n\r\nFor example, first we __select__ the element:\r\n`p { }`\r\n\r\nNext we __select the properties we want to change__:\r\n`p { color: }`\r\n\r\nFinally, we say what __values we want these properties to have__:\r\n`p { color: blue; }`\r\n\r\nSo we're going to make all paragraphs have blue text in this example.\r\nYou'll notice that there's a special language, or __syntax__ used for CSS, see the diagram below for some of this.\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/images/css_syntax.jpg \"The syntax can be tricky, so don't worry if you make mistakes.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Selectors (thing before the curly braces)\r\nSo now that you have a rough overview, we're going to go into a bit more depth.\r\n\r\nYou select in 4 different ways:\r\n1. elements - select all of a particular element in the page, `p { }` selects all paragraph elements on the page.\r\n2. class - select any elements on the page with that class, `.help { }` selects any elements with the class named 'help'. _(\".\" is how you specify a class name)_\r\n3. id - select the element with the id specified, `#about { }` selects the element with the id 'about', **remember id's should be unique, so it should only be one element selected.** _(\"#\" is how you specify an id name)_\r\n4. position in the document - select the elements contained within one or more other elements.\r\n  ```HTML\r\n  <div id=\"about\">\r\n    <p class=\"help intro\"></p>\r\n    <p class=\"help\"></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <p></p>\r\n\r\n  #about p {}  <!--Selects any p element inside an element with the id \"about\"-->\r\n  ```\r\n  The example above selects the first two `<p>` elements, but not the third as it's outside the `<div>` with the id \"about\"\r\n\r\n####Things to watch out for with id's and classes\r\nIn CSS, if you select an element using `#help` you'll get only the element with the id \"help\". \r\nIf you select using a class `.help` you'll select all elements with the class help, including those with other classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Declarations (what we want to change)\r\nCSS defines all properties of an element that you can change (unfortunately using the American spelling), for example:\r\n* `font`\r\n* `color`\r\n* `background-color`\r\n* `border`\r\n\r\nEach property has a set of values that can be applied, examples below:\r\n* `font: 12px normal Verdana, sans-serif;` - sets to 12 pixels and font style\r\n* `color: #123;` - set as colour value matching the hexadecimal value 123\r\n* `background-color: red;` - set as system colour red\r\n* `border: 1px solid rgb(193, 193, 193);` - sets the solid border as 1 pixel thick with colour of rgb value 193, 193, 193.\r\n\r\nProperties come in a variety of granularity, meaning how much fine detail control you have over them. For example the border example above is high granularity, as you can set the color, and width of each side of a border individually, but we set all 4 at once.\r\n\r\n`border: 1px solid #000;` is the same as\r\n```CSS\r\n  border-width: 1px;\r\n  border-style: solid;\r\n  border-color: #000;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThe shorthand used above must happen in that particular order, so if you can't remember it (which no one expects you to) either search for it in Google, or use the longhand version.\r\n\r\nUsing granularity, we can change specific parts of an element's style\r\n```CSS\r\np { border: 1px solid red; }\r\np.intro { border-color: blue; }\r\n```\r\nThis gives us a `<p>` with a 1px solid red border, but all `<p class=\"intro\">` have a blue border.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Units of measurement\r\nWe need to talk briefly here about the units used by CSS for determining elements relative size. Obviously we can't use anything like centimeters, as the browser has no way of telling what size monitor you're using.\r\n\r\nInstead CSS uses _absolute_ and _relative_ units of measurement.\r\n\r\n####Absolute\r\nAbsolute units use units that are always the same size, in this case pixels `px`.\r\n\r\n\r\n####Relative\r\nRelative units such as `em` and `%` are calculated relative to other characteristics.\r\n\r\n* `em` - always relative to the current value of font-size, `2em` sets size to twice current font size.\r\n* `%` - relative to different things in different contexts\r\n  * `width: 50%;` - 50% of the available width\r\n  * `font-size: 50%` - 50% of the current font size\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```CSS\r\nbody { font-size: 12px; }\r\nh1 { font-size: 200%; }\r\nh1 a { font-size: 75%; }\r\n```\r\nThis sets body's font size to 12 pixels, the h1 header's font size to twice body's font-size, giving us 24 pixels, and all links inside h1 to 75% of h1's font size, giving 18 pixels.\r\n\r\n\r\n####Typography (optional)\r\nAdditional information on where `em` comes from can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)).\r\n\r\nFont's are dependent on the fonts available on the Operating System of the computer browsing your web page, generally sans-serif fonts are better for web pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Putting the Cascade into Cascading Style Sheets\r\nIt's called Cascading Style Sheets for a reason, and that is because style is applied in the order you define it, meaning the last style defined is the one that takes effect.\r\n\r\nThere is a catch to this, that last _most specific_ selector is the one that takes effect, this is defined by a points system.\r\n\r\n| selector | points value |\r\n| -------- |  ----------- |\r\n| element  |       1      |\r\n|  class   |      10      |\r\n|    id    |     100      |\r\n\r\nSome examples of this are:\r\n* `p a {}` = 2 points (2 elements)\r\n* `p.intro a {}` = 12 points (element, class, element)\r\n* `#about p.intro a {}` = 112 points (id, element, class, element)\r\n\r\n\r\nCSS also has what's known as __inheritance__, this means if we define an attribute for an element, all elements inside it also __inherit__ that property, unless overridden.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this only applies to text-related properties such as colour, font, alignment, visibility etc. It doesn't apply to layout-related properties like borders, padding, background, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Layouts\r\nHere we're going to discuss 4 different types of layout used in CSS, and how they affect the positioning of elements on a page.\r\n\r\n####Box Model\r\nThis is the easiest to understand model, and comprises of _content_, _padding_, _border_, and _margin_. Every box has these properties\r\n\r\nThe diagram below displays each of these attributes around a box. The box contains the _content_ of the element, and around this is the _padding_, the _border_ surrounds this and then the _margin_ is on the outermost layer. If you set the background on a box element, this will go inside all attributes except the margin.\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/images/box_model.png \"The box model.\")\r\n\r\nWhen settings attributes on the box model using shorthand, defining `CSS margin: 1em 2em;` would set the top and bottom as 1em, and left and right as 2em.\r\n\r\nWhere as if we define it as `margin: 1em 2em 3em 4em;` this will set the top to 1em, right to 2em, bottom to 3em and left to 4em. This always starts with the top and goes clockwise.\r\n\r\n####Display\r\nThe two most commonly used attributes of display are _inline_ and _block_.\r\n_Inline_ boxes can appear next to one another, think of this like boxes are represented by words  in a sentence, each word is followed by another.\r\n\r\n_Block_ boxes take up an entire line, forcing other boxes onto the next line down.\r\n\r\n####Position\r\nThis defines where the elements will be displayed in relation to all other objects and will be covered in the exercise later. The only thing you need to know right now is that there are 4 values:\r\n1. static (the default)\r\n2. relative\r\n3. absolute\r\n4. fixed\r\n\r\n####Float\r\nLike position, this is best seen in practice as it can be confusing, so we'll cover it in the exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Recap\r\nSo we've seen a lot of stuff, don't worry if you don't remember it all, that's what Google is for! You should hopefully understand the basic concepts of cascading effects and the points system for specifying elements, those are the most important parts.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 different specifications for CSS, with CSS3 adding some cool new effects which you can go and look up if you want, or you can go straight to the exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCSS Walkthrough and Exercise\r\n----------------------------\r\nOkay for this section we're first going to just make some changes to a web page's CSS, refresh to see the effect and learn from observation what the particular attribute effects are, then move onto an exercise for you to attempt on your own.\r\n\r\nSo first of all, copy the contents of the [CSS walkthrough](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/exercises/css-walkthrough.html) and save it as an html file, then open it with your web browser of choice.\r\n\r\nIn the file you'll notice some CSS already there, leave that as it is, we're going to be copying and pasting in the commented out lines below this. The `#wd-c` id's refer to some html elements defined further below, standing for web developer container.\r\n\r\nInitially you should see the page render as 3 boxes, with the numbers 1 to 3 and colours red, yellow and blue respectively. These boxes are `<div>` containers, these take up an entire line, and if you resize you're window you'll notice that these  take up the entire width of the page, that's the default for div elements.\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice that there's a small gap between the divs and the screen edge, this is due to the default CSS built into the browser, that gives a default margin of 10px.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Chrome or Firefox, pressing F12 will give you a development console, by going into 'Inspector' for Firefox or 'Elements' for Chrome, you'll be able to click on individual parts of the HTML and see the CSS that's been applied for that particular element on the right of the panel.\r\n\r\nIf you're using firefox, you may want to install the [Firebug extension](http://getfirebug.com/).\r\n\r\n###Flow\r\nAt the bottom of that page you'll see the text about elements being either 'in' or 'out' of the flow. Elements in the flow cause sibling elements, those that follow it, to render with respect to the current element. If an element is out of the flow, the first div for example, then the second would appear where the first is currently.\r\n\r\n###Let's get to work!\r\n1. Copy and paste the first line into the uncommented section, and you should see the div elements inside the main container shrink to 150px wide, but the main container stays the same width.\r\n\r\n  _This shows us that divs always take up the maximum width of the screen by default, even if their contents don't._\r\n\r\n2. Let's try the next line. This changes the divs to _display inline, meaning that they consume only the amount of space that their contents do_, in this case the number inside them. _This overrides any settings of height and width._\r\n\r\n3. Add in the third line, and things should reset to make our blocks back to as they were after the first instruction. After this try the next line, and you'll see that the number 2 in the second div has been centered.\r\n\r\n  In inspector or elements mode if you hover over the 2 in the html, you'll see it doesn't take up any more space than before, but has just been placed midway between the left and right edges.\r\n\r\n4. Now let's set wd-2 to display inline. It doesn't have any effect, but why?\r\n\r\n5. Once you've figured out the answer to that we're going to add the next line, which specifies the same element, but this time it works as we expected. If you can't work out why this is happening, the easiest way to learn is to ask.\r\n\r\n6. Change the element back to being a block, then add in the following 3 lines to set the margin, padding and border. We have 1em of margin (1 font size width), 10px of padding and 2px of dotted border. Use the inspector and box model view to better see the changes that have been made.\r\n\r\n7. Next up is to change the second div's visibility. Note that once we do this the div still takes up the same amount of space.\r\n\r\n8. Next we'll set 2 to not display, which takes it out of the flow all together and makes it invisible as well. Now add in the next couple of lines to have it display block again.\r\n\r\n9. Make the changes to set it's position as absolute, and you'll see that 3 has rendered on top of 2, this is because we've taken it out of the flow, and if we add the next line, 2 will display on the right side of the main container.\r\n\r\n  _It may not look like it's completely at the right, but don't forget that there's the margin and padding to take into account!_ To see that this is the case, set the margin to 0, and 2 goes right to the edge of the screen.\r\n\r\n  Now we'll set the distance from the top of the screen to be 20px, and the bottom to 20px. Where does the box appear, and why do you think this is?\r\n\r\n10. Try settings top to auto, and see what changes happen, then do the same for bottom. Why is this?\r\n\r\n11. Reset the margin and set our position to static and we'll go back to where we started off after adding the margin, padding and border.\r\n\r\n12. Change the position to relative, and nothing seems to have changed. Try adding the left and top rules after this, what's happened?\r\n\r\n13. Set 2's position to be static again, and it's reset. Now try changing the container divs display to be inline. 1 and 3 have inherited the display inline, but 2 didn't, why?\r\n\r\n  Add in the more specific rule for 2 to set it to inline (hint), and the container div shrinks to the size of it's contents.\r\n\r\n  _As you can see, being specific with selectors can be a double-edged sword if you're not careful._\r\n\r\n14. Next up is float, add it to the container div and see what happens. The container has forgotten all about the divs which it previously contained, __and are being displayed in a block display, apart from taking up the whole line__.\r\n\r\n  The float effect is particularly useful for images, as it allows text to be wrapped around it.\r\n\r\n15. Finally, let's add the clear left to 2 first, and you'll notice 2 shifted down a line. This rule makes 2 have nothing on it's left, and if you apply this rule to 3, you'll see that we end up back where we were.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Intermission\r\nThis was undoubtedly confusing in places, that's web development, the trick to this is making a change, seeing what it affects and then reasoning why that happened and how you can get to your desired result.\r\n\r\nFeel free to go back through the previous section and try to understand it or discuss it with people around you.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Exercise\r\nIf you remember the demo website we looked at, we're going to be creating the navigation bar for it using only CSS, no JavaScript. (If you need a refresher, [here's the site](http://webremix.org/labs/lab2/demos/demo.html))\r\n\r\nSo first of all, get the example you're going to be working on [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSpeed/Web-Development-Fundamentals/master/exercises/css-exercise-unfinished.html) and as before, save it in an html file then open it in your browser.\r\n\r\nYou'll see the list we created in our html exercise, but open it in an editor and you'll see an id's been added.\r\n\r\nFrom here you need to follow the steps in the comments in the file:\r\n1. Make all of the list items render horizontally\r\n2. Make the second list's items render vertically\r\n3. Hide the second list\r\n4. Add padding, margin and background colour as needed.\r\n\r\n__Don't panic if you get stuck, it may be best to work together with 1 or 2 other people on this part. Take 10-15 minutes on your own to get it as close as you can. Use Google if you need to look up how to do certain things__\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJavascript\r\n----------------------------\r\nNow we've made it to the Javascript portion of the tutorial.\r\n\r\n###What's it for?\r\nJS makes pages interactive, such as hiding or showing a menu, validating form inputs and even drag and drop objects!\r\n\r\n###How do I use it?\r\nLike CSS, there are a few different methods and we'll cover them from the easiest option to the best one.\r\n\r\n1. Inline JavaScript(Bad)\r\n```HTML\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    ...\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    ...\r\n    <a href=\"javascript: doSomething()\">test1</a>\r\n    <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"doSomething()\">test2</a>\r\n    ...\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nHere we've added in some javascript that will execute when a user clicks on either of these links, but it's a __bad idea__ since it breaks the separation of content, style and behaviour.\r\n\r\n2. Embedded JavaScript(Better)\r\n```HTML\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    ...\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    ...\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n      doSomething();\r\n    </script>\r\n    ...\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nThis has embedded some JS into the HTML by adding it into the script tag, this allows you to keep all your JS in one place in your HTML file. It's better, but still not great.\r\n\r\n3. External JavaScript(Best of all!)\r\n```HTML\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    ...\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    ...\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"stuff.js\"></script>\r\n    ...\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nThis is the best option as it keeps your HTML and JS separate, and allows you to reuse one JS file for all pages on a web site.\r\n\r\n\r\n###What can we do?\r\nJavaScript is a programming language, so it allows you to do quite a lot! \r\nJS has become very popular in the past few years, with people making all kinds of cool libraries from data visualisation libraries like [d3](http://d3js.org/) and [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) to running [game engines in the browser](http://html5gameengine.com/).\r\n\r\nA common mistake made by people is thinking that JavaScript is similar to Java, _it's not_. Apart from a few syntactic similarities, they're very different.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this section isn't to teach you how to program, instead we'll cover best practices of how JS should be used. If you find the next few parts confusing, it'll get easier once you see how the JS affects interaction with the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Fundamentals\r\nLike all programming languages, JS has variables e.g. assigning 7 to the variable foo:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar foo = 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOperators can be used to do calculations:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar bar = 4 + (3 * 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nStrings are used to store text:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar baz = 'a string';\r\n```\r\n\r\nArrays are used to store multiple values:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\r\n```\r\n\r\nFunctions are defined like so:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar function = function(x, y) {//Do something};\r\n```\r\n\r\nConditional statements are used to control what happens in a program:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nif (something) {\r\n    //Do something\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoops are used to execute blocks of code multiple times:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nwhile (something) {//Do this}\r\nfor (var i=0; i<10; i++) {//Do this}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJS is also what's known as Object Oriented, this means you can create a new object, assign it to a variable and give that object properties and methods.\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar o = {}; //Create an object\r\n\r\no.isUpdated = false; //Property, a variable stuck to an object\r\no.updateNow(someData); //Method, a function stuck to an object\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n###How does it interact with the page?\r\nJS interacts with web pages through the Document Object Model (DOM). This is a tree of objects that matches the tree of elements in HTML.\r\n\r\nAn HTML page of:\r\n```HTML\r\n<html>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <p id=\"first\"></p>\r\n    <p id=\"second\">\r\n      <strong></strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p id=\"third\"></p>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould give a DOM of:\r\n_window\r\n \\- document\r\n    | p #first\r\n    | p #second\r\n      \\- strong\r\n    \\- p #third_\r\n\r\nThese objects are the handles that JS uses to modify the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n####DOM terminology\r\n|HTML|JavaScript|\r\n|----|----------|\r\n|element|node|\r\n|attribute|property|\r\n\r\n\r\n####Selecting elements\r\n#####getElementById\r\nThis function gets a specific element by it's ID, hence the name.\r\nFor example:\r\n```JavaScript\r\ndocument.getElementById('about');\r\n```\r\nwould get the same element as the CSS:\r\n```CSS\r\n#about {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#####getElementsByTagName\r\nThis gets many elements from the page, for example:\r\n```JavaScript\r\ndocument.getElementByTagName('p');\r\n```\r\ngets the same elements as the CSS:\r\n```CSS\r\np {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#####chaining methods\r\nBecause these methods can be called on any node object (an HTML element) you can chain them together.\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript\r\n```JavaScript\r\ndocuemnt.getElementById('about').getElementsByTagName('p');\r\n```\r\ngets the same elements as the CSS:\r\n```CSS\r\n#about p {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be all `<p>` elements inside the element with the id \"about\".\r\n\r\n####Node properties\r\n#####ParentNode\r\nThis lets us access the object that contains our currently selected element, for example if we had a `<div>` with three `<p>` tags inside it, if we selected any of the `<p>` tags and used '.parentNode', it would return the `<div>`.\r\n\r\n#####childNodes/firstChild/lastChild\r\nJust as we can go up the DOM, we can also use the methods named above to go down it.\r\n\r\nIf we had a `<p>` element which contained 3 `<span>` elements, 'childNodes' would get all the `<span>`s in an array, while firstChild would get the first one and lastChild the last one.\r\n\r\n#####nextSibling/previousSibling\r\nThese methods let us access elements on the same level of the DOM as the currently selected one, so as in the previous example if we selected the firstChild element, nextSibling would get the second `<span>`.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Execution Order and the DOM\r\nOne problem you may encounter is that if we put JS in the `<head>` of our page, the DOM won't have been created yet, and so any references to it won't work. One way around this is to put all JS in the head of the page into a function, which gets called at the end of the page, once the DOM has loaded, see the example below.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    ...\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"stuff.js\"></script>\r\n    ...  <!--No DOM nodes exist yet...-->\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div id=\"wrapper\"> <!--nodes are created -->\r\n    ...\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n      initialize(); <!--now we access and manipulate the DOM-->\r\n    </script>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Events\r\nThese allow us to perform certain behaviour based on certain actions occurring on particular elements or the page, some examples are:\r\n* click\r\n* mouseover\r\n* mouseout\r\n* mousedown\r\n* mouseup\r\n* blur\r\n* focus\r\n* load\r\n\r\nWe use events by attaching a __listener__ to an element, which listens for that action to occur.\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar el = document.getElementById('test');\r\nvar doSomething = function() {\r\n    //Do something!\r\n};\r\n\r\n//For internet explorer, we attach by doing\r\nel.attachEvent('onclick', doSomething);\r\n\r\n//For literally every other browser, we do:\r\nel.addEventListener('click', doSomething, false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSTOPPED AT 12:55 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdEn3P3ZbiY&list=PL697D36B35F92E9E4&index=7\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
