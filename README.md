Introduction
============================

First of all, lets take a look at what we use HTML, CSS and JavaScript (also known as JS) for.

The User Interface (UI) is the interface that we, as users, interact with. For web applications this is done through a web browser, like the one you're using to read this with. The UI is made up of 3 parts:
  1. Structure - The content of the UI.
  2. Presentation - How the content is displayed.
  3. Behaviour - How the content behaves when certain actions occur.
